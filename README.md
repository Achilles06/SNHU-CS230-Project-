    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    Your client, The Gaming Room, currently has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android systems. They would like to expand it to other operating platforms.
  Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit. Draw It or Lose It is a multi-user game application that must have the ability to run multiple instances of the game at once, each having players and teams. 
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
      
      Following the instructions on how to complete the program since this material was new to me. Not making anything overcomplicated and following the designe patterns that were given for the files and project with the UML. 
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
      Understanding the different structures of a UML design document. How the files, classes, attributes are linked together and displayed. Creating an UML and everything that should be involved.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      I would need to further my knowledge on better coding and design practices in order to answer that question.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    Theres was already an Andriod application in place. Using that as an template for the other OS systems.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    Keep practicing, studying, and staying dedicated to the project.
